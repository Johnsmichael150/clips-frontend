# ClipCash

**Turn your long videos into short viral clips — automatically, with full control, and optional NFT ownership.**

ClipCash helps content creators (YouTubers, podcasters, gamers, coaches…) save many hours of work by turning one long video into dozens or hundreds of short clips ready for TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and more.

You always stay in control:  
→ Preview every clip  
→ Choose which ones you like  
→ Delete the bad ones  
→ Then post only the good ones automatically

Bonus: you can also turn your best clips into NFTs on the Stellar network (very cheap & fast) so you truly own them and can earn royalties forever.

## What makes ClipCash special?

- **Full preview & selection** — most tools post random clips. ClipCash lets you see and pick only the best ones.
- **Automatic posting** to 7+ platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels, Snapchat Spotlight, Pinterest, LinkedIn)
- **Web2 + Web3 in one app** — normal accounts + optional Stellar NFTs with royalties
- **Simple & beautiful interface** — dark mode, clean design, easy to use
